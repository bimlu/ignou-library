The programme is intended to provide scientific knowledge and technical skills in the all aspects of beekeeping. The knowledge imparted shall facilitate for improved productivity.\n \nAbout the Programme:\nThere is always an increasing demand for the honey across the world. Still most of the honey is being collected from the wild resources (forest) and a limited amount is produced through commercial units. In the scattered commercial units, due to less technical knowledge and poor infrastructure, the honey production is less. A great potential exists in this area, where we may establish this unorganized sector into an organized one for the betterment of the society. \n \nAt village level, successful honey production provides   nutritional and economic security and also empowerment to the farmers, farm women, and rural youth. Beekeeping also helps conserve the natural resources. There is a need to impart improved technical know-how to the traditional beekeepers in order to facilitate the adoption of improved technologies available in this area.  The certification may be required to the beekeeper to seek any financial help from any banks, non-governmental or government agencies, etc. \n \nObjectives:\n·         Impart education about modern beekeeping.\n·         Build human resource in the beekeeping sector.\n·         Diversification of apiculture to increase income of the farmers.\n·         Develop entrepreneurial skills in beekeeping.\n \n ",

The United Nations through UN Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal has classified health care waste as the most hazardous waste, after radioactive waste.\n\nAccording to WHO, every year an estimated 16 billion injections are administered world wide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed off afterwards. In 2010, unsafe injections were still responsible for as many as 33 800 new HIV infections, 1.7 million hepatitis B infections and 315 000 hepatitis C infections. A person who experiences one needle stick injury from a needle used on an infected source patient has risks of 30%, 1.8%, and 0.3% respectively of becoming infected with HBV, HCV and HIV.\n\nThe main bottleneck to sound health care waste management programme is lack of training and appropriate skills, insufficient resource allocation and lack of adequate equipment.

It is an indispensable part of the activities of man’s everyday life. It is a spontaneous outcome of the human feelings and emotions in a melodious and rhythmic manner. Where words fail, music successfully conveys. Music plays a significant role in the lives of human beings.\n \n\nIndian music has developed within a very complex interaction between different people of different races and cultures. It appears that the ethnic diversity of present day Indians has been there from the earliest of times. History of Indian music unfolds the verity that music gradually changed in shape and form. The geographical conditions in India and the cultural complex of its people have throughout remained important determinants in shaping its music. Indian music also changed its shape by external influences.\n \n\nCertificate in Hindustani Music is to enable the learner to receive the basic knowledge of theory and practical aspects of Indian music. This will also enable the learner to realise that basically there was originally one music in our country. After passing through changes, it converted into two types of music — Hindustani and Karnatak.\n\n-----------------Courses-------------------\n\n\nCourseCode    \tCourse Name\tCredits \n OVA-001\t Indian Culture Heritage\t 2\n OVA-002\t Understanding India Art Forms\t 2\n OMU-001\t An Introduction to Indian Music -OMU-001\t 2\n OMUL-002\t Hindustan Music Performance-1\t 3\n OMUL-003\t Hindustan Music Performance-2\t 3\n OMUL-004\t Hindustan Music Performance-3\t 4\n\n-------------Related Information-----------\n\nProgramme Coordinator:\n\nDr Mallika Banerjee\nSchool of Performing and Visual Arts,\nIndira Gandhi National Open University,\nMaidan Garhi,\nNew Delhi - 110068\nEmail: mallikabanerjee@yahoo.com\nContact No: 011-29571656\n\n--------------Programme Guide--------------\n\nhttp://www.ignou.ac.in/upload/programme/Programme%20Guide.pdf\n\n",

It has a well-documented history which can be traced back thousands of years. Studying theatre is almost studying the history of the cultural heritage of the world.\n\nTheatre deals with human relations as existed in a particular age and mirrors it through the art form. So to know about theatre is to know about the traditions, customs, manners and behavioural patterns.\n \n\nAs an art form, theatre evokes finer sensibilities among human beings. Its major concern is to discuss human relationship in extremely sensitive movements; no other art form portrays human concerns so delicately yet so strongly. Theatre can be studied as an experience, viewed as an entertainment and performed as an instinct of human behaviour.\n \n\nThe Certificate Course in Theatre Arts aims to provide basic introduction to the art of theatre to the learners. This course offers both theoretical and practical inputs to the students.\n\n-----------------Courses-------------------\n\nCourseCode    \tCourse Name\tCredits \n OVA-001\t Indian Culture Heritage\t 2\n OVA-002\t Understanding India Art Forms\t 2\n OTH-001\t An Introduction to Theatre & Drama\t 2\n OTHL-002\t Voice & Speech\t 3\n OTHL-003  \t Physical Aspects of Acting\t 3\n OTHL-004\t Method Acting â€” Stanislavsky\t 4\n\n-------------Related Information-----------\n\n--------------Programme Guide--------------\n\nhttp://www.ignou.ac.in/upload/programme/Programme%20Guide.pdf\n\n\n",

This has also resulted in over exploitation of limited surface as well as ground water resources, and as a consequence consistently and continuously depleting ground water table.  The situation in urban areas is even more serious. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for not only conservation of water resources but also its augmentation through effective strategies and management, particularly in view of ever rising demand for water from various competing sectors. Rainwater harvesting essentially means collection and storage of the rainwater from rooftop or from a surface catchments for future use. This takes care of the ever growing requirement for water, increases soil moisture level thereby enhancing urban greenery, rise in the ground water table through artificial recharge and also improves quality of ground water. Town planners and civic authorities all over the country have introduced by-laws for encouraging rainwater harvesting. Despite various initiatives including legislative measures, very little rainfall is conserved and harvested.  There is a tremendous possibility for harnessing the rainwater for augmenting the existing water resources. This calls for generating mass awareness and dissemination of knowledge and skills with regard to rain water harvesting techniques and management for the optimal use of harvested water through trained human resource. This programme would especially be useful for those living in water scarce and drought prone areas.\n \nObjectives:\nThe programme aims at:\nsensitizing and educating learners on augmentation and utilization of water resources;\nimparting knowledge, skills and expertise to understand water harvesting techniques;   \nand\nenabling learners to act as trainers and organizers at household and community levels for efficient water management in terms of its usage and also for water conservation.\n\n-----------------Courses-------------------\n\nCourseCode    \tCourse Name\tCredits \n ONR-001\t Introduction to Water Harvesting\t 2\n ONR-002\t Basics of Hydrology\t 4\n ONR-003\t Water Harvesting, Conservation and Utilisation\t 6\n ONRL-001\t Practical Training at Water Harvesting Agency\t 4\n Programme Structure (CWHM)\t Programme Structure (CWHM)\t Programme Structure\n\n-------------Related Information-----------\n\nFee Concession:\nThe fee concession is available to the following category of students:\nAll the candidates from the rural areas shall be entitled for 50% fee concession subject to the production of domicile certificates.\nThe urban students below poverty line may also be given 50% fee concession subject to production of income certificate\nMedium of Instruction:\n  English\n  Hindi\n Target Group:\n   Residents of urban and rural areas particularly youth, housewives\n   Social workers, volunteers working with NGOs\n   Government functionaries dealing with Water Harvesting projects.\n \nJob Opportunities:\nCertificate holders will be fully equipped to serve various Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) dealing with water harvesting projects, Urban Housing Boards, Private Real Estate Builders, Soil Conservation Departments and Government Water Boards as Water Harvesting Assistants.\n \nCounselling sessions:\nThe programme has one course for practical. The participation in the practical session is an integral part of the programme. 75% attendance in the practical counselling session is compulsory to appear in the practical examinations. The counselling sessions are held at the study centres (usually during weekends) according to the schedule drawn by the programme-in-charge.

In the final result all the assignments of a course carry thirty percent weightage while seventy percent weightage is given to term-end examination.  You will have to complete three assignments for this programme, one for each course.\n \nYou are required to score at least thirty-five percent marks in both continuous evaluation (assignments) as well as term-end examinations separately.  In the overall computation also you must get at least same percentage in each course to claim the Certificate Programme in Functional English (basic level).\n \nASSIGNMENTS\nAssignments constitute the continuous evaluation system.  The submission of assignments is compulsory. Assignments of a course carry thirty percent weightage while seventy percent weightage is given to the term-end examinations. \n \nYou will not be allowed to appear for the term-end examination for a course if you do not submit the specified number of assignments on time, i.e for the December term-end examination, the last date of submission is 30th September and for the June term-end examination, the last date of submission is 31st March.\n \nThe evaluators/counselors after correcting the assignments send them back to you with their comments and marks. The comments guide you in your study and help in improving it. The assignments are designed in such a way so as to help you concentrate mainly on the printed course materials and exploit your personal experience.\n \nAll assignments are Tutor-Marked Assignments (TMA). For each CFE course there is one assignment that you must attempt. Whenever you receive a set of material and assignments, check them immediately and ask for missing pages, if any, from Material Production and Distribution Division, (IGNOU, Maidan Garhi, New Delhi – 110 068) or the Coordinator of your study centre.\n \nThe University/Coordinator of the Study Centre has the right not to entertain or to reject the assignments submitted after the due date.  You are, therefore, advised to submit the assignments before the due date.\n \nFor your own record, retain a copy of all the assignment responses, which you submit to the Coordinator. Also maintain an account of the corrected assignment responses received by you after evaluation.  This will help you to represent your case to the University in case any problem arises.\n \nIf you do not get a passing grade in any assignment, you have to submit it again.  However, once you get the pass grade in an assignment, you cannot re-submit it for improvement of grade.\n \nEXAMINATIONS\n \nThe primary component of the evaluation in CFE is the term-end examination.  For each Course, a student will have to obtain at least a D grade. The overall average should be at least D grade for the successful completion of a programme. The letter grade system used for terminal examination is explained below under section Term End Evaluation.\n \nIf a student fails to clear all the subjects in his/her first attempt, s/he can clear them in the subsequent examinations.  The term-end examination in CFE will comprise three papers, i.e, one paper each for the three courses in CFE.  The duration of each paper is three hours.  Each paper in CFE carries hundred marks.\n \nTERM END EVALUATION\n \nThe evaluation of the performance of the students in the term end examination will be based on both marks and grading system.\n \nLetter\nGrade\nNotional\nCorrelates\nCorresponding percentage in numerical marks\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nExcellent\nVery good\nGood\nSatisfactory\nUnsatisfactory\n70% and above\n55% and above but less than 70%\n45% and above but less than 55%\n35% and above but less than 45%\nbelow 35%\n \n \nTerm End Examinations will be conducted twice a year in June and in December.\nthanks\n \nCourse Coordinator-CFE\nProfessor Anju S Gupta\n\n--------------Programme Guide--------------\n\nhttp://www.ignou.ac.in/upload/programme/CFE%20P%20Guide.pdf\n\n",

Academic Counselling can be held at STRIDE office or may be internet based.\n \nStudents who have enrolled from abroad (outside India) can contact their sponsoring agencies or partner institutions for information on counselling.\n \nThe counselling sessions are not compulsory. However, we advise you to attend them as far as possible, because they would be very useful in certain respects to share your views on the subject with your Academic Counsellors and fellow learners; comprehend some of the complex ideas/concepts or difficult issues discussed in your materials, and get clarifications for many of your doubts which you would not have solved yourself.\n \nCounselling is not lecturing, though a counselling session may include a short lecture to trigger a discussion.
